 In this shard it's the inequality that's asserted. This means the assertion is considered successful if input to this shard does **not** match the `:Value` parameter of this shard. 

The rest of behaviour of this shard (including the impact of the value of the `:Abort` parameter) is identical to [`Assert.Is`](../Is).

Just like [`Assert.Is`](../Is), this shard too can be used for writing (inline) unit test cases.
