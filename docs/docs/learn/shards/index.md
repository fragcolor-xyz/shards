# Learn Shards

Shards is a programming language that helps developers create apps more efficiently. It does this by breaking down the app into smaller functional units called shards. These shards can then be easily connected to create more complex workflows. By using Shards, developers can create a variety of workflows that can be customized to fit specific needs, while improving the performance and scalability of a system.

If you're new to the world of Shards, our [primer](./primer/) is an excellent place to start. It covers the basics of Shards and you'll get a solid foundation which will allow you to tackle more advanced concepts.

However, learning the basics is only the first step. To truly understand Shards and use them effectively in your projects, you need to reinforce the concepts learned with hands-on experience. That's where our [tutorials](./tutorials/) come in. Our step-by-step tutorials provide practical examples and exercises that allow you to apply what you've learned to create playable games. With our tutorials, you'll gain the confidence and skills you need to start developing with Shards.
