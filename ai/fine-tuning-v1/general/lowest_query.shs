  prompt: """How do i get the lowest value from a table ?"""

  solution:
    """[1 2 3 4 5] = seq
    Lowest
    Log("resulting")"""

  explicit:
    """[1 2 3 4 5] = seq
    Lowest
    Log(Prefix:"resulting")"""

  explanation: """
    The Lowest Shard will parse a sequence and return the element with the lowest "value". If it is a sequence of integers or floats it will return the element with
    the lowest integer or float. If it is a sequence of strings it will return the element with the lowest value based on the lexicographical order.
