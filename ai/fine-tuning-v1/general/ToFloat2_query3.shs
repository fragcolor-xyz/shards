  prompt: """How do I convert a string to a float2?"""

  solution: """
   "5" ; string to convert
   ToFloat2
  """

  explicit: """
   "5" ; string to convert
   ToFloat2
  """

  explanation: """
    The ToFloat2 Shard converts an input with numeric value into 2-dimensional vector represented as two floating point numbers. If the input is one dimensional, 
    the Shard will assign 0.0 to the second floating point number.For example, in the solution provided above, ToFloat2 will out put (5.0 0.0). If the input is two
    dimensional, such as "3 2" it will assign the floating point numbers accordingly. If the input has more than 2 dimensions, the Shard will only use the first 2 values provided.
    If a string that has no numeric value such as "Three", "Five"or "hello" is passed in, the Shard will return (0.0 0.0)
