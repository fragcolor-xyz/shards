  prompt: """How do I convert a int to an int4?"""

  solution: """
   5 ; integer to convert
   ToInt
  """

  explicit: """
   5 ; integer to convert
   ToInt
  """

  explanation: """
    The ToInt4 Shard converts an input with numeric value into 4-dimensional vector represented as four integers. The value will always be rounded down to the nearest integer. If 
    the input is one dimensional, the Shard will assign 0 to the second, third and fourth integers. For example, in the solution provided above, ToInt4 will output (5 0 0 0). 
    If the input is two dimensional, it will assign 0 to the third and fourth integers. If the value has more than 4 dimensions, only the first four values will be used.
