  explanation: """
    The Match Shard Compares the input with the declared cases (in order of the declaration) and activates the shard of the first matched case. If there are no matched
    cases, the program will panic.

    The Passthrough parameter set to true will allow the original input (the one that was used to match against every case in the shard) to be returned as the final 
    output of Match, irrespective of the case match results. Setting Passthrough to false will enable the matched case's shard output to be returned as the final 
    output of Match.

    However, for Passthrough to work correctly, the data types of the shard input and the shard's case outputs must match.
