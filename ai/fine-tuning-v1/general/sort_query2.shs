  prompt: """How do I sort all the values of a sequence in descending order?"""

  solution: """
    [0 1 2 3 4 5] >= sequence

    Sort (
      sequence
      Desc: true
    )
  """

  explicit: """
    [0 1 2 3 4 5] >= sequence

    Sort (
      From: sequence
      ;; Join: sequenceB
      Desc: true
      ;; Key: 

    )
  """

  explanation: """
    Sort is a Shard that will parse through the sequence specified in the From parameter and sort it.  
    If :Desc is set to true the sequence is sorted in descending order, else it's sorted in the ascending order
    If another sequence is passed  into the Join parameter. The sequence in the Join parameter will mirror the final arrangement
    of the sequence passed into the From parameter. For this to work, both sequences need to be of the same length.
