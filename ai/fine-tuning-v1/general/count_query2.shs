  prompt: """How do I count the total number of key and value pairs that a table has ?"""

  solution: """
   Count(table-to-count)
  """

  explicit: """
    Count
    (
      Name: table-to-count
      ;;Key: key-to-count
    )
  """

  explanation: """
    Count parses the value passed to it in the :Name parameter, and returns the count of characters, elements, or key-value pairs depending on whether the data type passed to it was a string, a sequence, or a table.
    This Shard works on both sequences and tables. Parameter :Key applies only to tables.
