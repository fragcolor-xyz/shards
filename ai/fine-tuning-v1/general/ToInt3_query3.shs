  prompt: """How do I convert a string to an int3?"""

  solution: """
   "5" ; string to convert
   ToInt
  """

  explicit: """
   "5" ; string to convert
   ToInt
  """

  explanation: """
    The ToInt3 Shard converts an input with numeric value into 3-dimensional vector represented as three integers. The value will always be rounded down to the nearest integer. If 
    the input is one dimensional, the Shard will assign 0 to the second and third integers. For example, in the solution provided above, ToInt3 will output (5 0 0). If the input is two
    dimensional, it will assign 0 to the third integer. If the value has more than 3 dimensions, only the first three values will be used. If a string that has no numeric 
    value like "Three", "Five" or "hello" is passed in, the Shard will return (0 0 0 0).
