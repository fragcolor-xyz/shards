  solution: """
   Erase([index-to-delete] sequence-to-delete-from)
  """

  explicit: """
    Erase(Indices:[index-to-delete] Name:sequence-to-delete-from)
  """

  explanation: """
    Erase deletes single or multiple elements (from sequences) and key-value pairs (from tables).
    For a sequence, this Shard expects the index (or a sequence of indices in descending order) of the element(s) to be erased, followed by the 
    name of the sequence variable in the Name parameter.
