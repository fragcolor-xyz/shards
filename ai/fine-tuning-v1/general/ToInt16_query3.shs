  prompt: """How do I convert a string to an int16?"""

  solution: """
   "5" ; string to convert
   ToInt
  """

  explicit: """
   "5" ; string to convert
   ToInt
  """

  explanation: """
    The ToInt16 Shard converts an input with numeric value into 16-dimensional vector represented as 16 integers. The value will always be rounded down to the nearest integer. If 
    the input is one dimensional, the Shard will assign 0 to the second, third and fourth integers and o forth. For example, in the solution provided above, ToInt16 will output 
    (5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0). If the input is two dimensional, it will assign 0 to the third and fourth integers and so forth. If the value has more than 16 dimensions, 
    only the first 16 values will be used. If a string that has no numeric value, like "Three", "Five" or "hello" is passed in, the Shard will return (0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0).
