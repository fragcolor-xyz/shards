  prompt: """How do I check if something is not something else."""

  solution: """
   variable1
   When(IsNot(variable2) {
    Pass ;Do Something
   })
  """

  explicit: """
    Get(variable1)
    When(Predicate:IsNot(Value: variable2) Action:{
      Pass ;Do Something
    })
  """

  explanation: """
    The IsNot Shard when used in the Predicate parameter of a conditional Shard, like When, will check if the input of the conditional Shard does not match with what is
    stated in the Value parameter of the Is Shard. In the solution above, if variable 1 does not equal variable2, the When Shard's Predicate will return true and execute what is stated
    in Action.

    If the input and Value parameter have different data types they will be assessed as inequal by default even if they are numerically equal (for example int 5 is not equal to float 5.0).
