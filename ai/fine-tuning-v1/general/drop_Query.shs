  prompt: """How do I remove the last element in the sequence and return the remaining sequence?"""

  solution: """
   Drop(sequence-to-drop)
   Log("Remaining Sequence")
  """

  explicit: """
    Drop(Name: sequence-to-drop)
    Log(Prefix: "Remaining Sequence")
  """

  explanation: """
    Drop removes the last element of the sequence variable that has been passed to in the :Name parameter. Unlike the Pop Shard which will return 
    the popped element, Drop will return the remaining sequence as output.
