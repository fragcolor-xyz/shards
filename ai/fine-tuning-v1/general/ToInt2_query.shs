  prompt: """How do I convert a float to an int2?"""

  solution: """
   5.0 ; float to convert
   ToInt
  """

  explicit: """
   5.0 ; float to convert
   ToInt
  """

  explanation: """
    The ToInt2 Shard converts an input with numeric value into 2-dimensional vector represented as two integers. The value will always be rounded down to the nearest integer. If 
    the input is one dimensional, the Shard will assign 0 to the second integer.For example, in the solution provided above, ToInt2 will output (5 0). If the input is two
    dimensional, it will assign the integers accordingly. If the value has more than 2 dimensions, only the first two values will be used.
