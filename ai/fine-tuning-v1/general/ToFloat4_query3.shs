  prompt: """How do I convert a string to a float4?"""

  solution: """
   "5" ; string to convert
   ToFloat4
  """

  explicit: """
   "5" ; string to convert
   ToFloat4
  """

  explanation: """
    The ToFloat4 Shard converts an input with numeric value into 4-dimensional vector represented as four floating point numbers. If the input is one dimensional, 
    the Shard will assign 0.0 to the second, third and fourth floating point number in the solution provided above, ToFloat4 will output (5.0 0.0 0.0 0.0). If the input is two
    dimensional, it will assign 0.0 to the third and fourth floating point number. If the input has more than 4 dimensions, the Shard will only use the first 4 values provided.
    If a string that has no numeric value like "Three", "Five" or "hello" is passed in, the Shard will return (0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0)
