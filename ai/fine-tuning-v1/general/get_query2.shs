  prompt: """How do I read a value of a key from a table."""

  solution:
    """{k1: 1 k2: 2 k3: 3} = table

    Get(table k1 0)
    Log("Key read")"""

  explicit: {
    {k1: 1 k2: 2 k3: 3} = table

    Get(Name:table Key:k1  Default:0)
    Log(Prefix:"Key read")
  }

  explanation: """
    Get can be used to read the value of a Key from a table. While the Take Shard can also be used, there is a difference between the two. The difference being, if Get
    is trying to read a key that does not exist and no default value is provided, it will throw and error. Take on the otherhand will return none. Unlike Take, Get
    can also place a default value through its Default parameter for a key that does not exist yet.
