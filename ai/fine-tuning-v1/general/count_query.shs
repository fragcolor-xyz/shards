  prompt: """How do I get the total number of elements in a sequence?"""

  solution: """
   Count(sequence-to-count)
  """

  explicit: """
    Count(
      Name: sequence-to-Count
      ;; Key: key
      )
  """

  explanation: """
    Count parses the variable passed to it in the Name parameter, and returns the count of characters, elements, or key-value pairs depending on 
    whether the data type passed to it was a string, a sequence, or a table. Parameter Key applies only to tables.
