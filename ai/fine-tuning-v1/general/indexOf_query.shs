  prompt: """How do I find the index number of a specific element in a sequence?"""

  solution: """
   sequence
   |IndexOf(item-to-find)
   > index-of-item
  """

  explicit: """
   Get(Name:sequence)
   IndexOf(Item: item-to-find)
   Update(Name: index-of-item)
  """

  explanation: """
    Index of will take a sequence as an input and search through the sequence until it finds an exact match of the item stated in the Item parameter. Once a match
    has been found, it will return the index of the matched item.
