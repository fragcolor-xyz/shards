  prompt: """How do I convert a float to an int8?"""

  solution: """
   5.0 ; float to convert
   ToInt
  """

  explicit: """
   5.0 ; float to convert
   ToInt
  """

  explanation: """
    The ToInt8 Shard converts an input with numeric value into 8-dimensional vector represented as eight integers. The value will always be rounded down to the nearest integer. If 
    the input is one dimensional, the Shard will assign 0 to the second, third and fourth integers and so forth. For example, in the solution provided above, ToInt4 will output 
    (5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0). If the input is two dimensional, it will assign 0 to the third and fourth integers and so forth. If the value has more than 8 dimensions, only 
    the first eight values will be used.
