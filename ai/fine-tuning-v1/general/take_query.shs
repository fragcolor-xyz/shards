  prompt: """How do I get an element of a specific index in a sequence?"""

  solution: """
   [0 1 2 3 4] = sequence

   sequence
   Take() ;; Replace 0 accordingly with the desired index
  """

  explicit: """
   [0 1 2 3 4] = sequence


   Get(sequence)
   Take([0]) ;; Replace 0 accordingly with the desired index
  """

  explanation: """
    Take will get and return the specific element from the sequence passed in as input. The element it gets is of the index specified in its parameter. A
    sequence of indices can also be specified in its parameter. If a sequence of indices is specified, Take will return a sequence of elements. These elements are
    derived from the sequence passed in as input and are of the indeces specified in the sequence of indices. In the scenario provided under solution, Take will return
    the 0th element from the sequence.
