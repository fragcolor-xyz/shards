  prompt: """How do I get the highest value from a sequence"""

  solution:
    """[1 2 3 4 5] = seq
    Highest
    Log("resulting")"""

  explicit:
    """[1 2 3 4 5] = seq
    Highest
    Log(Prefix:"resulting")"""

  explanation: """
    The Highest shard will parse a sequence and return the element with the highest "value". If it is a sequence of integers or floats it will return the element with
    the highest integer or float. If it is a sequence of strings it will return the element with the highest value based on the lexicographical order.
