  prompt: """How do I remove the first element in the sequence and return the remaining sequence?"""

  solution: """
   DropFront(sequence-to-drop)
   Log("Remaining Sequence")
  """

  explicit: """
    DropFront(Name: sequence-to-drop)
    Log(Prefix: "Remaining Sequence")
  """

  explanation: """
    DropFront removes the first element of the sequence variable that has been passed to in the Name parameter. Unlike the PopFront Shard, DropFront will return the remaining
    sequence as output.
