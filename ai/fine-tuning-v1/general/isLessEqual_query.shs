  prompt: """How do I check if something is less than or equals to something else."""

  solution: """
   variable1
   When(IsLessEqual(variable2) {
    Pass ;Do Something
   })
  """

  explicit: """
    Get(variable1)
    When(Predicate: IsLessEqual(Value: variable2) Action:{
      Pass ;Do Something
    })
  """

  explanation: """
    The IsLessEqual Shard when used in the Predicate parameter of a conditional Shard, like When, will check if the input of the conditional Shard is less than or equals to what is
    stated in the Value parameter of the Is Shard. In this case, if variable 1 is less than or equals to variable2, the When Shard's Predicate will return true and do what is stated
    in Action.
