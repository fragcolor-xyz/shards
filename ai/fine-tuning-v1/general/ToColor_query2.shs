  prompt: """How do I convert a float to a RGBA color value"""

  solution: """
   5.0 ; float to convert
   ToColor
  """

  explicit: """
   5.0 ; float to convert
   ToColor
  """

  explanation: """
    The ToColor Shard converts an input with numeric value into 4-dimensional color vector represented as four integers.
    The first integer represents the Red value, the second integer represents the Green value, the third integer represents the Blue value and the last integer represents the Alpha.
    The value will always be rounded down to the nearest integer. If the input is one dimensional, the Shard will assign 0 to the second, third and fourth integers. 
    For example, in the solution provided above, ToInt4 will output (5 0 0 0). If the input is two dimensional, it will assign 0 to the third and fourth integers. 
    If the value has more than 4 dimensions, only the first four values will be used.
