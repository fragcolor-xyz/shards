  prompt: """How do I add two values together?"""

  solution: """
    3 | Math.Add(2)
    Log("Result") ;; the result will be 5
  """

  explicit: """
    3 | Math.Add(Operand:2)
    Log(Prefix:"Result") ;; the result will be 5
  """

  explanation: """
    Math.Add is a Maths Shard which will take a numeric value as input and a value specified on in the Operand paramater and perform the addition 
    mathmatical operation. Math.Add can also take in a sequence of floats or integers as input and as a value for the Operand parameter. In this scenario
    it will add  the values of each corresponding index and return a sequence. Both the input and the operand needs to be of the same type for the Shard to function.
    Unlike Math.Inc which is a unary operation,  Math.Add is a binary operation.
