  prompt: """How do I get the absolute value of a signed variable?"""

  solution: """
    -3
    Math.Abs
    Log("reseult") ;; result will be 3
  """

  explicit: """
    -3
    Math.Abs
    Log("reseult") ;; result will be 3
  """

  explanation: """
    Math.Abs is a Maths Shard which takes in a signed numeric value as input and return its absolute value. If a sequence is given as input,
    Math.Abs will parse through the sequence and  return a sequence of absolute values.
