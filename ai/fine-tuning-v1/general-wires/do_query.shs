  prompt: """How do I execute a wire from the main wire and continue the main wire after complete execution of the executed wire."""

  solution: """
   @wire(main-wire{
    Do(other-wire)
   })
  """

  explicit: """
   @wire(main-wire{
    Do(Wire:other-wire)
   })
  """

  explanation: """
    The Do Shard is a wire executor.  When called, it will run the wire specified in the Wire parameter inline within the current wire.
    The called wire will execute from the start every time it is called and run synchronously within the context of the parent wire.
