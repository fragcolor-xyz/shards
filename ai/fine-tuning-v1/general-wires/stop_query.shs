  prompt: """How do I stop a wire?"""

  solution: """
   @wire(main-wire{
    Stop(wire-to-stop)
   })
  """

  explicit: """
   @wire(main-wire{
    Stop(Wire:wire-to-stop)
   })
  """

  explanation: """
    Stop is a Shard that will stop a wire from executing. The wire can be executed again but it will be executed from the start, unlike
    Suspend which can be re-executed from the point of suspension. If no wire is fed into the Wire parameter, it will Stop the current wire.
