  prompt: """How do I execute and generate multiple wires that will execute inline to the parent wire."""

  solution: """
   @wire(main-wire{
    [1  2  3]
    DoMany(other-wire)
   })
  """

  explicit: """
   @wire(main-wire{
    [1  2  3]
    Do(Wire:other-wire)
   })
  """

  explanation: """
    DoMany is a shard that will generate and execute multiple wires inline to the parent wire. As opposed to Do which will only generate
    one wire that is reused, DoMany will generate a number of wires depending on the number of elements in the sequence passed in as input.
