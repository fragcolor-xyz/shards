  prompt: """How do I stop a wire from executing momentarily for a period of time"""

  solution: """
   @wire(wire{
    Pause(0.5)
   })
  """

  explicit: """
   @wire(wire{
    Pause(Time: 0.5)
   })
  """

  explanation: """
    The Pause Shard is a Shard that stops a wire from being executed momentarily for a period of time. If the wire is called by a wire 
    Executor Shard within the time frame specified in the Time parameter, it will be ignored.
