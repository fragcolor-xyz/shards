ReadFile
Description: The purpose of ReadFile and WriteFile shards is to enable saving and loading of workflow state to and from files. WriteFile serializes the input data and writes it to a file. This allows saving the state of a workflow to disk, so it can be resumed later. ReadFile reads data from a file and deserializes it. This allows loading previously saved workflow state from disk, so the workflow can resume from where it left off. Together, ReadFile and WriteFile provide persistence for Shard workflows. Complex workflows with many steps and branches can be paused, saved to disk with WriteFile, and later loaded and resumed with ReadFile. This is useful for long running workflows that need to survive restarts of the workflow runner.

Input: No input
Output: Depending on the set parameters, the output can be either a single string representing the path to a selected file, or folder, or a sequence of strings representing the paths to multiple selected files.
Filters: Allows users to filter visible files based on their extensions. It can take a sequence of strings, or a single string as input (either directly or by reference). Setting this parameter can restrict the dialog to display only files with specific extensions.

Snappy.Compress
Description: Compresses the input bytes using the Snappy compression algorithm.
Input: Bytes containing the data to be compressed.
Output: Bytes containing the compressed data.

Events.Check
Description: Designed to monitor and indicate the reception of events from the specified event dispatcher. When activated, it checks if an event of the specified name (and optional ID) has been dispatched since the last check. Instead of collecting the actual events like the Events.Receive shard, it simply outputs a boolean indicating the presence of such an event.
Input: Accepts an input type of None, meaning it acts independently of incoming values and focuses solely on the presence of dispatched events.
Output: If an event with the specified name (and optional ID) was dispatched since the last check, it will output true. If no such event was dispatched, it will output false.
Name: Specifies the name of the event dispatcher to monitor. It's a required parameter that can accept values of type String or a variable of type String. The shard will listen to the events dispatched by the specified dispatcher.
ID: Can be used to further narrow down the event checking based on a specific ID, especially useful when multiple events share the same name. If no ID is provided, a default mechanism will be used to search for events in the given context.

UI.GetClipboard
Description: Retrieves the current text in Operating System's clipboard.
Input: Ignored.
Output: The text currently stored in the Operating System's clipboard.

Description: The Fast Fourier Transform is an algorithm to compute the Discrete Fourier Transform. Converts a signal from its original domain (time or space) to a representation in the frequency domain.

Output: Produces a sequence of complex numbers (sequence of 2 floats) representing the frequency domain of the input sequence.

Events.Receive
Description: Allows users to receive events that are dispatched. It listens for events dispatched through the provided event dispatcher name and optional ID, collecting them into a sequence, and outputting them when activated. The shard can be used to differentiate events based on their names and optionally an ID.
Input: Does not expect any input and the type of input it accepts is NoneType. This means it doesn't act upon any specific incoming value, but rather listens for dispatched events.
Output: A sequence (AnySeqType) of events it has received since the last time it was activated. Each event in the sequence is of the type which has been previously set for the associated event dispatcher.
Name: Specifies the name of the event dispatcher to use. It is a required parameter that accepts a String or a variable of type String.
ID: Used to differentiate events that share the same name. It can be of type Int, a variable of type Int, or NoneType if an ID is not provided. If not provided, a default ID will be used to search for events based on the context.

FS.Write
Description: Writes the given string or bytes to the specified file path, optionally appending or overwriting the file if it already exists.
Input: Absolute or relative path to the file.
Output: The file path written to.
Contents: A variable containing the string or bytes to write as the file's content.
Overwrite: If true, overwrites the file if it already exists.
Append: If true, appends the contents to the end of the file if it already exists.

IsMore
Description: Checks if the input value is greater than the value specified in the Value parameter. Outputs true if the input is greater, false otherwise.
Input: Any comparable value such as numbers, strings, etc. One of the values to check if it is greater than the other.
Output: A boolean indicating if the input value is greater than the Value.
Value: The value to compare the input value against to check if the input is greater. Must be of a comparable type to the input value.

Listen
Description: A consumer component designed to listen to broadcast channels. It fetches data from its subscribed channel and outputs them either singularly or as a sequence based on the buffer size. If the broadcast channel is closed, the shard checks if there's any stored data in its buffer and outputs it. If the buffer is empty, it signals the flow to stop and outputs an empty value.
Input: The primary function of the input is to trigger the shard's activation.
Output: If the buffer size is greater than one, the output will be a sequence containing the buffered values. Otherwise, it will output individual values.
Name: Specifies the name of the channel the shard should listen to.
Type: Defines the expected type of data the shard will receive. It is essential and should match the data type being broadcasted in the channel.
Buffer: Dictates how many values the shard should buffer before outputting them. If set to 1, the shard will output values immediately upon receipt. If set to a value greater than one, the shard will buffer the values and output them as a sequence once the buffer limit is reached.

FS.IsDirectory
Description: Checks if the given path refers to an existing directory.
Input: A string representing a filesystem path. This is the path that will be checked.
Output: A boolean indicating if the given path exists and is a directory.
